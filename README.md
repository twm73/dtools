# Installation [**↑**](#Table-of-Contents)
## ZXP/UXP Installer  [**↑**](#Table-of-Contents)
From the `03 installer` directory, download the [`zxp`](./03%20installer/Minesweeper%201.0.0.zxp) file with the latest version of the extension.
![](./04%20documentation/images/download-file.png)
The easiest way to install is to use an extension manager. I highly recommend the brilliant [ZXP/UXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer) program for this.
It is extremely easy to use. After installing and launching, just drag the file with the extension onto it.

**Important! Extensions need to be installed for current user only!**

You can choose this option during installation or change it later in the settings:
